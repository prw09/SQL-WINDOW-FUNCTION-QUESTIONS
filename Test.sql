WINDOW FUNCTIONS QUESTIONS ......

### Question 1: Calculate the running total of `TotalAmount` for each order placed by each customer.

SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    OrderID, 
    OrderDate, 
    TotalAmount, 
    SUM(TotalAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM Orders;


### Question 2: Determine the rank of each product within its category based on price.
 
SELECT 
    ProductID, 
    ProductName, 
    CategoryID, 
    Price, 
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID ORDER BY Price DESC) AS PriceRank
FROM Products;
 

### Question 3: Find the average `TotalAmount` of orders for each customer and the difference of each order's `TotalAmount` from the customer's average.

SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    OrderID, 
    TotalAmount, 
    AVG(TotalAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS AvgTotalAmount, 
    TotalAmount - AVG(TotalAmount) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS DifferenceFromAvg
FROM Orders;


### Question 4: Calculate the cumulative quantity of each product sold across all orders.

SELECT 
    ProductID, 
    SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantitySold, 
    SUM(SUM(Quantity)) OVER (ORDER BY ProductID) AS CumulativeQuantitySold
FROM OrderItems
GROUP BY ProductID
ORDER BY ProductID;


### Question 5: Identify the most recent order date for each customer.

SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    OrderID, 
    OrderDate, 
    MAX(OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS MostRecentOrderDate
FROM Orders;


### Question 6: Calculate the percentage contribution of each products price to the total price of all products within the same category.

SELECT 
    ProductID, 
    ProductName, 
    CategoryID, 
    Price, 
    Price / SUM(Price) OVER (PARTITION BY CategoryID) * 100 AS PricePercentage
FROM Products;


### Question 7: Find the first order date and last order date for each customer.

SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    OrderID, 
    OrderDate, 
    MIN(OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS FirstOrderDate, 
    MAX(OrderDate) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID) AS LastOrderDate
FROM Orders;


### Question 8: Calculate the difference in days between consecutive orders for each customer.

SELECT 
    CustomerID, 
    OrderID, 
    OrderDate, 
    LAG(OrderDate, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY OrderDate) AS PreviousOrderDate, 
    DATEDIFF(OrderDate, LAG(OrderDate, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY CustomerID ORDER BY OrderDate)) AS DaysBetweenOrders
FROM Orders;
